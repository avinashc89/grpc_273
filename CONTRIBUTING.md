# How to submit a bug report

If you received an error message, please include it and any exceptions.

We commonly need to know what platform you are on:
 * JDK/JRE version (i.e., ```java -version```)
 * Operating system (i.e., ```uname -a```)

# How to contribute

We definitely welcome patches and contributions to grpc! Here are some
guideline and information about how to do so.

## Before getting started

In order to protect both you and ourselves, you will need to sign the
[Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.developers.google.com/clas).

We follow the [Google Java Style
Guide](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html). Our
build automatically will provide warnings for style issues.
[Eclipse](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/eclipse-java-google-style.xml)
and
[IntelliJ](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/intellij-java-google-style.xml)
style configurations are commonly useful.

If planning on making a large change, feel free to [create an issue on
GitHub](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/new), visit the [#grpc IRC
channel on Freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=grpc), or send an
email to [grpc-io@googlegroups.com](grpc-io@googlegroups.com) to discuss
beforehand.

## Proposing changes

Make sure that ```./gradle build``` (```.\gradle.bat build``` on Windows)
completes successfully without any new warnings. Then create a Pull Request
with your changes. When the changes are accepted, they will be merged or
cherry-picked by a gRPC core developer.
